# Title

Tensorflow Extended (TFX) What is it? Why should I care? How to use it

# Abstract

Tensorflow Extended (TFX) is Google's end-to-end ML configuration framework. TFX will open doors for you that you didn't know existed. It uses Apache Airflow for workflow orchestration, Apache Beam for batch and stream processing, and a lot more.

# Description

## WHO
**is the intended audience for your talk?**

The intended audience is software engineer, ML engineer, or data engineer. Data scientists may also find it interesting as a pattern to train and deploy their models.

## WHAT
**are you going to be talking about and WHAT will people learn from your talk?**

I will be talking about Tensorflow Extended (TFX). Here is the excerpt from Google's site on what is TFX:

> TFX is a Google-production-scale machine learning platform based on TensorFlow. It provides a configuration framework and shared libraries to integrate common components needed to define, launch, and monitor your machine learning system. 

People will learn the core concepts of TFX and should be comfortable to start diving in to TFX as a result of listening to this talk.

## WHY
**is your talk important/interesting/useful? Explain why people would want to attend your talk.**

Even if you never end up using TFX, the number of technologies that it connects will interest and excite you. Apache Airflow is used create an end-to-end ML workflow as a Directed Acyclic Graph. Apache Beam is used to process data. Data is transformed, artifacts are stored, new models are evaluated, and then promoted to be served if they outperform the previous model.

## HOW
**will you be delivering your talk?**

The talk will be presented as diagrams and code. The talk could fill either 30 or 45 minutes. 

### Outline

Here's an outline of how the talk will be presented. This will be on a 30 minute talk scale. Format is the number of minutes and a summary of the section

1 - intro, bio on myself, this will be relevant to the talk

1 - summarize the outline of the talk

1 - very high level summary of what is TFX - the goal is to say enough to lay a base foundation for the listener to understand the next segment on **why**

1 - why - high level of why this talk is relevant and will benefit the listeners

4 - detail a level lower of the components of TFX and what they do - the goal is to explain enough that when doing the walkthrough of each components, understanding the overall picture will help for understanding individual components more

18 - walk through each TFX component, what it does, what libraries are involved, and how it interacts with other TFX components. This will consist of diagrams and code

2 - conclusions and thoughts - summarize the walk through and share thoughts on TFX

2 - questions

## Additional Notes

If this talk is accepted, in September 2019, I will have been into Machine Learning for 2 years. I come from a unique background of software engineering and not data science. I enjoy each step of machine learning. I attended PyTorch Developer Conference in October 2018. I attended the Tensorflow Dev Summit via livestream in March. I have built ML models. I have built ML data preprocessing flows and other pieces to an ML data pipeline.

I have a blog where I have been blogging about my TFX journey. I will leave it out of the proposal for now because it's supposed to remain anonymous. Please let me know if you would like my blog links, and I can add them.

I discuss this in my blog. At this point I am halfway through my learning of TFX. I am currently learning and working with Tensforflow Transform and Tensorflow Serving. I will be done with my overview in July, and would then have additional time to learn and prepare for this talk.

## Bio

I am currently a software engineer at Sony for 1 year using Python for internal tools and AWS. Before this, I worked as a full stack developer using Python Django and EmberJs for 3 years at Service Channel. Before that, I worked in Las Vegas for 3 years using SQL, where my last position was Sr. Database Analyst at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino.

I've been using Python for 6 years.

In my current role, I mentor a lot of Python and lead some of our Python programming projects.

I enjoy software testing. This has been beneficial for some of the machine learning projects that I've done. All of my projects are hobby projects and open source and can be shared if it makes sense.
