# Cracking the Coding Interview

Four general categories to be jugded on

1. Analytical ability
2. Coding
3. Experience
4. Communication

## Categories of Questions

System Design and Memory Limits

Bit Manipulation

## War Stories

Pop diva

- don't be too opinionated

Communication

- speak clearly
- don' talk forever, clear concise answers


## Things to practice

### Coding Exercises

factorial

max area of a rectangle based upon total length

sum of sets

implement merge sort

### System Design

design a large distributed cache

### General

virtal machine

- system virtual machine - Vagrant

	- emulate a computer but not on it's own hardware

- process - JVM, EVM


### Recursion

linear - where there is a single recursive call

tail - where the recursive call is the last thing that the function does

binary - where there are 2 recursive calls within the function. Ex: fibonacci, this also means that it has exponential growth
